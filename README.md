This library is a .Net wrapper for the [Txtmark](https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark) markdown processor. It aims to be simple and quick to use.

### Projects Aims
Currently the project is a library that you use in your .Net applications. In the future I hope to add a **console application** version so that anyone can use the library to convert Markdown to Html.

### Background
I noticed that there were few options for converting Markdown into Html in the .Net framework, as well as in general. I found a library that made this task simple to do, however it was written in java. That is where my .Net wrapper came into play.

### How to use
Make a reference to **Ozone.Markdown** in your project.

To convert Markdown to Html, use the function:

``
Ozone.Markdown.Parser.ParseMarkdown(markdown)
``

Where *markdown* is a string of Markdown text. The function returns a string, which is the converted Html.

Make sure in the Debug folder of your application, you have all of Ozone.Markdown's required libraries as well (there are 3 of them).

### Binaries and dependencies
You can download the library and its dependencies from the [releases](https://github.com/theryan722/Ozone.Markdown/releases/) page.

Ozone.Markdown has three dependencies:

* IKVM.OpenJDK.Core.dll
* IKVM.Runtime.dll
* txtmark.dll
 
These are required in order for Ozone to work.
